.This project is a URL shortener service built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

.The entry point of the application is index.js. It sets up an Express server, connects to MongoDB using the connectToMongoDB function from connect.js, and defines the routes for the application.

.The application has a single route /url defined in routes/url.routes.js. This route uses the urlRouter which is an instance of Express Router. The urlRouter handles GET and POST requests. The GET request returns a simple HTML message, while the POST request calls the creatingShortLink function from controllers/url.controller.js.

.The creatingShortLink function generates a short ID for the provided URL using the nanoid library, checks if the URL already exists in the database, and if not, creates a new document in the database with the short ID, the original URL, and an empty click history.

.The URL data is modeled using the URL schema defined in models/url.model.js. The schema includes a unique short ID, the original URL, and a click history which is an array of timestamps indicating when the short URL was accessed.

.The application also has a route /:id in index.js which is used to redirect short URLs to their original URLs. When this route is accessed, it updates the click history of the corresponding URL in the database and redirects the user to the original URL.

.To run the project in development mode, use the dev script defined in the package.json file:
